# Dlytful Product Brief v2

## The One-Liner

**Dlytful translates what you built into what people see.**

---

## The Problem

Indie developers ship functional apps with Bolt, Lovable, Cursor, and Replit. The code works. But when someone lands on their site, they see a generic template. Same fonts as 10,000 other startups. No clear message. No reason to remember them.

Branding is usually an afterthought. Most founders can't describe what "looks right" until they see it. They can't write the prompt that would make their app feel like *theirs*.

---

## The Solution

Dlytful is a live brand translation experience. Answer questions, watch your Brand Prompt build in real-time. Every answer unlocks something visible. Copy and paste into Bolt at any point—even after one question.

The "aha moment" happens in the first 5 minutes, then keeps happening.

**Old model (what we're NOT):** Questionnaire → Wait → Results  
**Dlytful model:** Input → Instant preview → Input → Preview evolves → Unlock depth

---

## What is a Brand Prompt?

A **Brand Prompt** is the deliverable. It's structured text that users paste into Bolt, Lovable, or Replit. It transforms their app's visual identity and voice without touching functionality.

Brand Prompts include:
- Positioning statement (who it's for, what makes it different)
- Visual direction (colors with psychological rationale, typography)
- Voice rules (sounds like, never sounds like, banned words)
- Brand energy (derived from their inputs)
- Archetype alignment (personality framework)

One paste. The app transforms.

---

## The Name

"Dlytful" captures the essence of a perfect summer day. That rare, golden moment where everything aligns effortlessly. Warm but not harsh. Bright but not glaring. The day your friends bring up months later.

This is the energy Dlytful helps indie developers create in their products.

---

## Target User

Solo founders, indie hackers, and small teams who ship products with intention. People who'd rather have 100 users who truly get it than 1,000 who merely use it.

They've built something real. They just need help making it look like it has a soul.

**They use:** Bolt, Lovable, Replit, Cursor, v0  
**They want:** To feel proud of how their product looks, not just that it works  
**They struggle with:** Describing what "right" looks like until they see it

---

## Brand Positioning

**For indie developers and solo creators who ship with intention, Dlytful is the micro-SaaS brand strategy partner that turns what your product does into what it means because great products already have a soul—they just need the words to match.**

---

## Brand Archetype

**Primary: Explorer**. Independent builders who think differently. They don't follow the standard playbook; they discover their own way.

**Secondary: Creator**. They care about craft. They want to build something real and express something true.

**The feeling:** "I found a better way because I didn't follow the crowd. And now people understand why."

---

## Visual Identity

### Colors

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Dlytful Sun | #FF9A00 | Primary. Warm, approachable. Late afternoon light. |
| Dlytful Sky | #007FFF | Secondary. Clear, calm. Grounding without coldness. |
| Dlytful Cream | #FAF7F2 | Background. Off-white with character. Lived-in, not sterile. |
| Dlytful Herb | #79B972 | Accent. Earthy green. Used sparingly for unlocks and success states. |

### Typography

**Primary:** Poppins. Neutral, readable, modern.

**Secondary:** Fraunces. Used sparingly in headers and branding moments.

### Design Philosophy

The palette rejects the aggressive, high-contrast tech aesthetic. No electric blues. No cold minimalism. Warmth that doesn't try too hard. Natural light. A palette that feels like stepping outside on a good day.

---

## Voice & Tone

**Sounds like a real person.** Never corporate. Never passive. No "solutions" or "leveraging."

**Respects intelligence.** We don't over-explain. Your audience understands nuance.

**Feels earned.** Every word does work. No fluff.

**Stays grounded.** We let the work speak.

**Celebrates progress.** Small wins matter. Every unlock is worth acknowledging.

---

## The Core Experience: Progressive Unlock

The magic is in the micro-interactions. Users don't fill out a form and wait. They see their Brand Prompt building live.

### The Split-Screen Experience

**Desktop:** Left panel = questions. Right panel = live Brand Prompt preview.  
**Mobile:** Swipeable panels or bottom sheet preview.

### The Unlock System

Every answer unlocks something visible:

| Question | What Unlocks |
|----------|--------------|
| Q1: What does it do? | Basic positioning appears. "Copy Prompt" activates. |
| Q2: The "this is good" moment | Voice preview + Color suggestions emerge |
| Q3: Current state | Before/After concept preview |
| Q4: Who gets it? | Persona card appears |
| Q5: What they'd tell friends | Copy angles preview |
| Q6: Prior frustration | Positioning sharpens |
| Q7: What you're NOT | Anti-patterns list + Voice "never" rules |
| Q8: Jargon check | Banned words list populates |
| Q9: The opposite | Archetype recommendations begin |
| Q10: Perfect day feeling | Brand energy + Colors finalize |
| Archetype selection | Full persona + voice rules |
| Validation (max) | Advanced prompts unlock |

**Key principle:** Users can stop at ANY point and get value. Q1 alone gives them something usable.

### Celebrations

When something unlocks:
- Subtle animation (fade in, scale up)
- "✨ Unlocked!" badge
- Emoji + message (e.g., "🎨 Your brand is taking shape!")

This creates the feeling of Bolt/Lovable—input → visible output → delight.

## The Rules System: Deterministic + Probabilistic

### Why This Matters

Branding has hard rules that work. Positioning statements need a specific structure. Voice rules need specific categories. Color choices need psychological grounding.

But within those rules, every brand should feel unique. The language, metaphors, and specific choices should feel like *theirs*, not a template.

### Hard Rules (Deterministic)

These are non-negotiable. We enforce them silently.

**1. Positioning Template**
```
For [target audience], [brand name] is the [category] that [point of differentiation] because [reason to believe].
```
Structure never changes. AI fills the blanks. Users see it building.

**2. Voice Rules Categories**
Always three: `sounds_like`, `never_like`, `never_words`  
If AI doesn't populate all three, we add sensible defaults.

**3. 12 Archetypes Only**
Innocent, Sage, Explorer, Rebel, Magician, Hero, Everyman, Lover, Jester, Caregiver, Ruler, Creator.  
No AI-invented archetypes. These are proven frameworks.

**4. Color Psychology**
Every color suggestion includes *why*. Not just "blue"—"Clear blue (#007FFF)—evokes trust and reliability, grounding for a professional brand."

**5. Banned Words**
These never appear in outputs:
> synergy, leverage, solution, cutting-edge, innovative, seamless, robust, best-in-class, thought leader, disrupt, game-changing, paradigm, holistic, scalable, turnkey...

Silently removed. Users never see corporate jargon in their Brand Prompts.

### Soft Rules (Probabilistic)

These are AI-generated, user-controlled.

- Specific language within templates
- Metaphors and analogies from their inputs
- Copy angles (creative interpretations)
- The translation of "perfect day" → brand energy
- Archetype recommendations (suggestions, not mandates)
- Social bio and one-liner variations

---

## Validation: Flags and Warnings

Users should always feel in control. We surface issues, explain rationale, let them decide.

### Quality Flags (Soft)

Inline hints that suggest improvements. Users can dismiss.

Examples:
- "Your positioning could be more specific. What makes you truly different?"
- "Your target audience might be too broad. Who specifically gets the most value?"
- "Voice traits like 'professional' don't differentiate. What specific personality should come through?"

**UI treatment:** Yellow/amber hint below the relevant section. "Dismiss" option.

### Contradiction Warnings

When choices create tension, we explain but allow.

Examples:
- "You selected 'Rebel' archetype but your positioning emphasizes 'reliability.' These can work together, but you'll want to be intentional about how rebellion shows up in a trustworthy way."
- "Your 'Sage' archetype typically sounds 'authoritative, knowledgeable, analytical.' Your voice rules don't obviously reflect this. This can work if intentional."

**UI treatment:** Warning card with "Keep my choices" and "Help me reconcile" buttons.

### Input Flags (Informational)

When user inputs contain jargon, we note it softly.

Example:
- User types: "We provide innovative solutions..."
- Inline hint: "Words like 'innovative' can feel corporate. We'll translate this into more human language."

**Not blocking. Just informing.**

---

## The Discovery Flow

Five parts, each unlocking deeper outputs:

### Part 1: Quick Win (0-2 min) — All tiers

**Q2:** Walk me through the moment someone uses this and thinks "this is good."  
**Q3:** Paste your current app URL, or describe what it looks like now.

**Unlocks:** Basic positioning, voice preview, color preview

**Users can stop here.** They have a usable Brand Prompt.

### Part 2: Your People (2-4 min) — dlytful one+

**Q4:** Who immediately understands what you've built? Not age and job title. Who are they actually?  
**Q5:** What would they say about your product to their friends?  
**Q6:** What were they frustrated with before they found you?

**Unlocks:** Persona card, copy angles, sharpened positioning

### Part 3: Your Edge (4-6 min) — dlytful one+

**Q7:** What do you absolutely NOT want your brand to feel like?  
**Q8:** Would you ever use words like "solution" or "leverage" to describe your product?

**Unlocks:** Discoverability Prompt, Agent Voice Prompt, sprint comparison, export

---

## Archetype System

Users see a wheel of 12 brand archetypes. Based on their discovery answers, 2-3 are highlighted (AI recommendation). Others are visible but desaturated.

**Key interaction:** Click to select primary. Click again or shift-click for secondary.

**Tension detection:** If primary + secondary have natural tension (e.g., Rebel + Caregiver), we surface a warning. User can keep their choice or explore alternatives.

**Tier access:**
- dlytful zero: See recommendation, no selector
- dlytful one: 6 archetypes available, can select primary + secondary
- dlytful max: Full 12, with combination explanations

---

## Key UX Principles

### The Aha Moment is Immediate

Not after 10 minutes. Not after completing everything. After the first question. Users paste, something shifts. That's the hook.

### Everything Unlocks Something

No question feels pointless. Every answer produces visible change in the preview.

### Users Control the Outcome

We suggest, flag, warn. We never block. They decide what their brand is. We help them articulate it.

### Fork and Iterate

Sprints can be forked from any point. Iteration is core to the founder journey. Different directions, same starting point.

### No "AI" Mentions

Everyone knows. Keep it under the hood. The technology is invisible. The outcome is everything.

### Clean Exports

Markdown and Notion templates feel like theirs, not Dlytful's. Their brand, their document.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Live Preview Engine

- **Reactive state:** Every input change updates preview immediately
- **Optimistic updates:** Show user's words in template instantly, enhance with AI
- **Debounced generation:** Wait 800ms after typing stops, then call AI
- **Progressive enhancement:** Basic preview works without AI; AI makes it better

### AI Integration

**Model:** Gemini 2.5 (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`)  
**Structured outputs:** JSON responses for reliable parsing  
**System instruction:** Hard rules embedded, soft guidelines suggested

### Validation Pipeline

1. **User inputs** → Flagged inline (soft, informational)
2. **AI generates** → Hard rules enforced silently
3. **Output validated** → Quality flags surfaced
4. **Contradictions checked** → Warnings shown with user choice
5. **User approves** → Final Brand Prompt ready

---

## Go-to-Market

### Phase 1: Waitlist (Week 1)

Landing page collecting emails for a free PDF: "The I Built This in a Weekend Brand Kit."

PDF delivered via email. Dlytful branding throughout. CTA at the end: "Too lazy to do this manually? Dlytful does this for you."

### Phase 2: Launch

Potential partnership with a daily newsletter for founders (150,000 active readers). Give away the PDF, see if they convert to dlytful one and dlytful max.

### Phase 3: Community

- Share Brand Prompts that work well (with permission)
- "Before/After" showcases
- Integration partnerships with Bolt, Lovable, Replit (even just documentation)

---

## Success Metrics

**Primary:** Time to first "Copy Prompt" click (target: < 5 minutes)

**Secondary:**
- Unlock completion rate (how many unlocks do users reach?)
- Flag acknowledgment rate (do users read/address flags?)
- Sprint iteration rate (do users fork and refine?)
- Return rate (do users come back?)

**North Star:** Users who paste, see improvement, and tell someone about it.

---

## What Dlytful Is Not

Dlytful is not a logo generator. Not a template library. Not a design tool. Not a questionnaire you fill out and wait.

Dlytful is a live translation experience. It extracts what founders meant and converts it into language that Bolt understands—while they watch.

Great products already have a soul. Dlytful helps them speak.

---

## The Feeling We're Creating

Remember the first time you used Bolt or Lovable? You typed something, hit enter, and *something appeared*. That moment of "wait, it actually works?"

Dlytful is that feeling for branding.

Type one sentence about your product. Watch positioning appear. Answer another question. Watch colors emerge. Keep going. Watch your brand take shape.

By the time you paste into Bolt, you already know it's going to work. Because you watched it being built.

That's dlytful.
